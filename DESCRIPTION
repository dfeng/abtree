Description: Given two possible treatments, there may exist subgroups who
    benefit greater from one treatment than the other. This problem is relevant
    to the field of marketing, where treatments may correspond to different
    ways of selling a product. It is similarly relevant to the field of public
    policy, where treatments may correspond to specific government programs. And
    finally, personalized medicine is a field wholly devoted to understanding which
    subgroups of individuals will benefit from particular medical treatments. We
    present a computationally fast tree-based method, ABtree, for treatment effect
    differentiation. Unlike other methods, ABtree is designed to produce decision
    rules for optimal treatment assignment for individuals. The treatment choices
    are selected on basis of maximizing the overall occurrence of a desired binary
    outcome, conditional on a set of covariates. In this paper, we show that ABtree
    performs well in simulation settings and produces intuitive results on a real
    dataset.
